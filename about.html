<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Mikael, and I’m a 29-year-old from Brasília with a passion for both technology and the arts.<br/>
   Currently, I’m pursuing a degree in Computer Science, where I’m diving deep into the world of coding and problem-solving.<br/>
   Beyond the digital realm, I’m also a musician. Whether it’s creating music or playing instruments,I find joy in expressing myself through sound.<br/>
   When I’m not studying or making music, you can often find me playing video games or engaging in sports, both of which keep me energized and inspired.<br/>
   Thanks for visiting my site—I’m excited to share my journey with you!</p>
